# VR Show & Tell

To show off the capabilities of VR inside our school, I built a scene on **Unity** and connected it to the **Meta Quest Pros**, creating an experience that allows the user to **move around and view models**. This project made me master a new software I had never used before, fight the limits of Macbook and Windows, and troubleshoot the fickle VR headsets. I expanded on my patience and willingness to explore deeper into topics more foreign to me.
