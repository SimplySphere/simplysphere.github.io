## Motivating Questions + Objective
- How can i interview someone to learn problems they see from their **unique perspective**
- How can I think of unique solutions to **mr strom's problem** of **lac of interdisciplinary overlap** at webb
- How can i create an **app with a ui** that offers both a creative and intuitive solution to his concern?

**Objective:** fulfill mr strom's problem of a lack of **interdisciplinary engagement** in the program 


## Materials
- VS Code

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Interview** finding mr strom with a pure cold approach and asking for his time before doing an interivew in which i only asked a few warm up questions, one main question, and a lot of follow-ups that i thought of from what i felt was nowhere i felt very proud of how i structured the interivew though because the follow-up questions were both asking for something unique every time but also insightful and built of what he just said, leaving some time for some fun questions which mr strom enjoyed
2. **Drafting 10 ideas**: creating a list of 10 ideas was difficult especially with the time given as we scrambled to think of ideas that were not parodies of each of
3. **Isolating one**: choosing one that felt intuitive it was high tech but i felt like it was unique to the point where i did not want to pass up the opportunity to try making something like it
4. **Discovering Gemini**: never used gemini intentionally before not to mention its api so i had to make an account and register for a key thankfully i got some credits to use for free for now but later on it would be a paid service
5. **Scrapping for starters**: going onto webb website for starters by copy and pasting every single class on there
6. **Base code**: writing code to call api needed multiple files that would come together to form purpose
7. **Prompt Adjustment**: took 50+ interations/trials of trial and error and making adjustments/revisions every time landed on system of seeds up to 5 that generate different topics and encourage niche
8. **Overextending with Onrender**: after this i immediately jumped without any ui in mind to get it onto a website code maker ive never used before, hoping to knock this thing out in a few hours, unfortunately it proved way too complicated as it was so i had to backtrack
9. **Tkinter UI**: create ui starting with tkinter with 50+ tries to land on final version had to find proper organization because there was a lot of parts this is definitely most complex ui ive made mostly because i dont make uis often
10. **Pygame Pivot**: over time the performance required me to go with pygame for mvp as i made the ui more visually acceptable

## Problems + Solutions
- **Proper pacing**: being way too enthusiastic to start and burning myself out early before i even got to website/ui elements, jumping to onrender early and wasting a lot of time working with something i have never done before even though it was clearly too much for what i wanted which was much less focus on the appearance/presentation more focus on the product itself, and finally finding time in the end to close out the ui and move onto replit with the very short amount of time i had before the deadline
- **Finding time**: busy schedule especially with science fair and its deadline looming i had to find time and work at the get go no procrastination able or else i know i would have not been able to finish ive never made a ui like this before so this is really new to me so having the time and making it more so was the main solution to my problem
