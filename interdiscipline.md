## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Interview** finding mr strom with a pure cold approach and asking for his time before doing an interivew in which i only asked a few warm up questions, one main question, and a lot of follow-ups that i thought of from what i felt was nowhere i felt very proud of how i structured the interivew though because the follow-up questions were both asking for something unique every time but also insightful and built of what he just said, leaving some time for some fun questions which mr strom enjoyed
2. **Drafting 10 ideas**: creating a list of 10 ideas was difficult especially with the time given as we scrambled to think of ideas that were not parodies of each of
3. **Isolating one**: choosing one that felt intuitive it was high tech but i felt like it was unique to the point where i did not want to pass up the opportunity to try making something like it
4. **Discovering Gemini**: never used gemini intentionally before not to mention its api so i had to make an account and register for a key thankfully i got some credits to use for free for now but later on it would be a paid service
5. **Scrapping for starters**: going onto webb website for starters by copy and pasting every single class on there
6. **Base code**: writing code to call api needed multiple files that would come together to form purpose
7. **Prompt Adjustment**: took 50+ interations/trials of trial and error and making adjustments/revisions every time landed on system of seeds up to 5 that generate different topics and encourage niche
8. **Tkinter UI**: create ui starting with tkinter with 50+ tries to land on final version had to find proper organization because there was a lot of parts this is definitely most complex ui ive made mostly because i dont make uis often
9. ending with pygame for mvp
10.

## Problems + Solutions
- **Finding my group:**Patrick left without proper notice and shifted his focus entirely to laser cutting, becoming unresponsive to the idea of a ball mechanism. Colin was initially interested but soon left with Patrick. At that point, I realized I was on my own and needed to make adjustments quickly. I tried reaching out to Charlie, but he said he did not have any code and was not really looking to partner up. I felt very lost, especially knowing that the project counted and deadlines were approaching. I looked around and identified two other possible groups, but I did not have a clear way to communicate with them by the time I was pondering which one to join after class. While thinking about my options, I decided to use community dinner as an opportunity to talk things through. That is when I spoke with Thomas about collaborating with his group, and in the end, I was able to form a partnership and move forward from there.
- **Last-minute fixes:** Noticing a critical problem at the last minute is never fun. That is exactly what happened. The stepper motor at the bottom of the mechanism was shaky due to the movement, something I did not expect or plan for when designing. Unlike the motor fitted inside the ball itself, the bottom motor was not a tight fit. To fix this, I decided to design an insert, a plug that could slot into place and hold the motor securely. I designed it the morning of the presentation and printed it that same day since we had only noticed the issue the night before. I planned carefully, adjusted quickly, and made sure everything worked as intended.

## Main Takeaways  
- **Fixing intuitively:** Throughout this process, I messed up on multiple occasions, and the only reason I was able to stay on track and keep going was that I did not overcomplicate my solutions. Interestingly, most of these fixes involved a drill. The first time was when I designed the other half of the ball incorrectly, causing it to rotate the wrong way. Drilling out the hole so the D-shaft could not catch it worked perfectly. The second time was when the plug I designed did not account for the wire outcropping area. Once again, a drill solved the issue by removing a quarter of the plug. The last one was when the D-shaft was too loose inside my mechanism, so I had to hot-glue most of the parts so that they would stick together. These moments taught me that simple, intuitive fixes can often be more effective than complete redesigns. 
- **Finding my people:** In team projects, you cannot expect everything or everyone to follow your wavelength or even your goals. Everyone has their own agendas and priorities, and while I already knew this from past experiences, living through it is always a learning process and not the most fun one. I do not blame anyone, but if I were all-powerful, I know I would have tried to change some people’s minds to push for what I wanted to see in the final result. Since that is obviously not possible, I have learned that I need to find people I trust and work well with. Forcing myself or others into a direction is not fair to either side. Moving forward, I want to keep this in mind and focus more on compromise and communication at every step instead of getting ahead of myself.

## Reflection
I came into the project more confident than I probably should have been. I had gotten ahead early and built something that felt genuinely functional, so it hit hard when others seemed not to really care about it. It felt like all the effort and emotion I had put into the design was wasted, and I started doubting whether I even deserved that initial pride. At one point, I considered scrapping the whole idea and just following along with my partner’s direction. Instead, I took a step back, paid attention to my options, and looked for people I knew I could work well with. While Thomas was not my first choice, he was available, familiar, and easy to work with, and that ended up making all the difference.

I think this project was more of a social project than an engineering one, even though it was an engineering challenge in every way. Most of the difficulties I faced over these weeks were not technical, but instead involved connecting with people and finding a group where I could fully apply myself. There were a lot of ups and downs, but I am glad everything worked out in the end and that I had a final result to show, because that was never guaranteed.

Walking out of semester one, I feel like I have grown not just technically but also as a collaborator and peer. Tech Seminar pushed me into areas I hadn’t really explored before: CAD, 3D printing, sensors, motors, and new ways of thinking about code. Almost all of this was new to me, and I tried to take the challenge head-on. Through reflection and journaling, I made sure to pull something meaningful out of every stage of the process. Looking back, I feel like I really and completely engaged with the project and did myself justice.
