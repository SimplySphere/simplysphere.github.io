## Motivating Questions + Objective
- How can I **bridge hardware with software** or **join CAD and code** to create a **3D scanner** that uses this mechanism?
- How can I **connect with my peers** to implement an aspect I did not explore in depth?

**Objective:** 


## Materials
- VS Code
- Arduino IDE
- Fusion 360 for CAD modeling  
- 2 stepper motors (25mm tall NEMA 17)  
- Screws and mounting hardware
- UNO R3 Super Starter Kit
- Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F IR Distance Sensor
- USB cable
- Completed & printed gimbal

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Starting high:** came out of thanksgiving break still on a high from being able to finish the design immediately asked patrick if he had looked into the code more which he said he had he was the only one of the two of us in our inital partnership that was working on the code while i was working on the cad because i had a design when we decided to split so naturally i thought he was gonna do some magic and get the code going 
2. **Hit of reality:** however that did not happen it took more than a week before he had any code running the mechanism in fact no one had any working code so i had to wait while i confirmed during that time i tried to understand the coding teams job better and appreciate what they were doing additionally i normally do coding and personally i think of myself much mroe as a coder than designer so i was personally interested in the code however when mr raus introduced laser cutting everyone started to follow that idea and suddenly my ball structure was ignored before it was ever given a chance
3. **A week of lows:** for a while i didnt know who to really work with patrick started to work with collin and i tried asking charlie but he didnt have much of a response and he had no code i needed someone who code and experience because the deadline was approaching and i had not gotten the necessary skills needed to operate arduino ide and with finals rapidly approaching i knew i needed to basically outsource and seek collaboration however this was not easy as it felt wrong to basically leave my partner for another because i technically was assigned to patrick but he seemed to have no intention to work with me and my ball mechanism
4. **Reaching out:** I started paying more attention to the people around me specifically someone who i have worked successfully before so i decided to talk to thomas during community dinner because we sit next to each other on a sunday night he had code but not much of a mechanism and i had no code and a mechanism we decided this was a good partnership and started work i taught him the design and how everything connected while he gave a rundown on the code progress so then i became part of thomas and kaydens group
5. **Finding time:** Finals were happening and everyone was stressed and tired i know especially for me not only did i have finals i also had a tennis tournament i had an sat to take and i had science fair which was something i knew i had to get ahead on because there was a lot less time than i thought so i had to be super efficient and not allow myself to take it so easy in the past few weeks unfortuantely that did cut away some of my self enjoyment time but i think the result was satisfactory in that i felt much mroe proud and satisifed with teh work i had done
6. **Until the last minute:** we discovered a small issue and i had to cad something that had to work first try and turns out it didnt which usually happens with 3d design so we went to robotics to drill out a whole quarter of it but then it worked and the problem of the mechanism being a bit too loose on the bottom was solved
7. **Demonstrate final form:** we presented on thursday after a morning of hard work starting at 5:30 getting everything prepped and checking in to the library as early as possible to start printing but overall the presentation went well and i finished tech sem semester one on a high note
