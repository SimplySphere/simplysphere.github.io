# 3D Scanner 

## Motivating Questions + Objective
- How does the **sensor** work? How does the **arduino** work? How does the **computer** fit into this? 
- How do we set up a sensor, arduino, and computer to get a result?
- How do we translate analog voltage readings into precise distances?

Objective: Create a **3D scanner** that uses **Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F analog IR distance sensors** to measure **distance between physical objects**.

## Materials
- Computer that can run code
- UNO R3 Super Starter Kit
- Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F IR Distance Sensor
- USB cable
- Measuring tape
- Desmos

## Step-by-Step Process


## Problems + Solutions
- **Unstable wires**: Our first problem was that the sensor wires kept popping or dropping out of the breadboard. We were not tugging or handling it with abandon, but they kept falling off, causing inconsistent readings. We fixed this by being extra careful when handling the setup, making sure all connections were secure. This helped make the data much more reliable.
- **Flipped equation**: The second problem was that we accidentally flipped our equation when inputting values into Desmos for a power regression. We were converting distance to voltage instead of voltage to distance. I realized the mistake when I looked at the graph on the provided website while thinking about inverse functions, which Mr. Raus mentioned a minute before. Catching that error helped us correct the voltage response to get accurate distance.
