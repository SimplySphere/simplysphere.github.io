# Checkpoint (February break)

## Motivating Questions + Objective
- How to **respect** and **revive** another group's work, **building off of it** while **communicating with the group itself**?
- How to design an **underwater ROV** that has **six degrees of freedom**, **eight propellers**, and **waterproof needs**?
- How to get an underwater ROV to be **able to run**?

**Objective:** To **respectfully revive** Jake and Jonathan's **previous work**, designing and building an **underwater ROV** for the museum


## Materials
- Blue ROV 2
- Jake & Jonathan's old ROV + documentation

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Find the parts**: We first heard about this project during our Unbounded activity debrief, where we learned there was an opportunity to build an ROV. After we got permission to proceed, we tracked down Mr. Hamilton and located the ROV outside the robotics lab.
2. **Reach out**: Thomas initially contacted Jake and Jonathan, but they did not respond for about a week. Since I was on 359 and shared a server with them, I reached out as well, and they replied within minutes. That’s how we re-established communication.
3. **Acquire documentation**: Once we were in contact, we asked for their documentation. We explained what we were trying to do and promised to give updates. They quickly shared a document covering multiple years of their work and also gave us access to their CAD files.
4. **Coordinate a team**: We called a meeting in the robotics lab to see who else was interested. Three additional people showed up and expressed interest, so it is important to note that Thomas and I are not the only ones invested; there is a real base of support to help make this initiative happen.
5. **Blue ROV 2 first**: After weighing options, we decided the priority was to get something moving as quickly as possible. While Thomas began inspecting the ROV physically and reviewing instructions, I downloaded the software and tried to connect the Blue ROV 2 to my computer. The connection partially worked, but we immediately ran into a major issue: there was no battery, meaning the system could not fully power on. This will be a key logistics problem to solve once we return from break.

## Problems + Solutions
- **Initially ghosted**: When Thomas reached out, Jake and Jonathan did not respond at first. That may have been because Thomas did not share any servers or mutual connections with them, so the message looked random or got filtered. It’s also possible they have privacy settings that limit who can contact them. When I reached out through a shared 359 server, they responded quickly, so the solution was to use a shared community channel to establish trust and visibility.
- **Having no battery**: We discovered the missing battery while I was connecting the ROV to my computer. Even though everything was plugged in correctly, the status stayed yellow instead of green, which suggested the system wasn’t fully powered. Once we noticed the battery was missing, the situation made sense. The plan is that when we return from break, we will ask the museum staff where the battery is. Since the submarine/ROV has been stored for a long time, the battery may have been removed and placed separately for safety.

## Main Takeaways  
- **Planning for the long term**: This is not a quick build. If we aim to fully complete it, it is closer to a final project than a short activity. Thomas and I expect it to take months, with a lot of learning, before we get “clean” results. After the break, the goal is consistent progress, using each workday to move the project forward.
- **Using references/past work**: Building on someone else’s work felt different than inheriting software code. This is physical, incomplete, and full of choices we didn’t personally make. Going through it felt like looking through the history of the team that came before us. That also means we have a responsibility to treat their work carefully and turn it into something real.

## Reflection
Thomas and I definitely bit off a lot. It does not feel impossible, but it will be challenging. Our time so far has been limited, and we did not have all the parts or a clear plan at the start. We also do not yet have the expertise needed to jump straight into building at full speed. Right now, the project is a slow ramp-up: learning as we go and trying to produce occasional visible progress.

It is also too early to predict exactly how far we can take this, but I am excited to continue after February break. I want to rest, reset, then come back ready to push the project forward.
