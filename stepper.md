# Spherical Two-Axis Dual-Stepper Scanner Gimbal

## Motivating Questions + Objective
- How can I **rotate a scanner smoothly in two independent directions using stepper motors**?
- How do I design a structure that fits **two steppers inside a sphere** without collisions or instability?
- How can I design and present my CAD work in a way that inspires others to replicate or improve this idea?

**Objective:** Create a mechanism that lets a **scanner** rotate smoothly on **two independent axes** using **two stepper motors** inside a sphere and base. This type of setup is called a **gimbal**, a structure that enables controlled rotation. Inspired by **ball turrets from Star Wars**, I am adapting the idea into a fully spherical form that others can study, understand, and rebuild.


## Materials
- Fusion 360 for CAD modeling  
- 2 stepper motors (25mm tall NEMA 17)  
- Stepper motor dimension reference sheets  
- 3D printer 
- Screws and mounting hardware
- UNO R3 Super Starter Kit
- Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F IR Distance Sensor
- USB cable

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Initial concept and inspiration:**
2. **Test low-fidelity prototypes:**
- 
3. **Researching dimensions:**
- 
4. **Create medium-fidelity look-alike:**
- 
5. **Revise and finalize design:**
- 
6. **Iterative design with revision:**
- 
7. **Present and demonstrate final design:**
- 


## Problems + Solutions
- **Finding dimensions**: finding reference sheet - nemo 17 had to research myself to find -- found a chinese reference using diagrams i got the numbers, still missing height of motor base and jut-out for cable -- had to measure myself; still needed those for the scanner so i reached out ot patrick to ask for it because i did not know them and he had just measured them before me
- **Finding leeway** finding the extra space to give the shaft so that it maximizes friction while also allowing the shaft into itself without a big struggle; leveraged the d shaped shaft to be a better fit (now fit is directional); initally was too tight at 0.10mm, was still too much at 0.15mm finally last designw as 2.5mm of offset, which worked


## Main Takeaways
- **Steppers demand exact spacing and alignment**, which forced me to take measurement seriously instead of approximating.  
- **Mechanical design is iterative**, not linear. Almost every part needed multiple revisions as new constraints appeared.
- **Importance of lower fidelity for testing:**
